This is an unfortunately but deliberately omitted feature. Most browsers download link targets when alt-clicking on links, and most thumbnail galleries link each thumbnail to its full size source. Therefore, you do not actually need an addon to download most thumbnail galliers. For more complex galleries, addons dedicated to this purpose exist. You could also install Copy Selected Links and use a download manager.\n\n\nThe Options screen will automatically open after add-on updates if they force a change to any of your settings.\n\nPlease rate/review/donate! :)\nA lot of time and work goes into creating my addons, and making changes or troubleshooting issues for users. This particular addon has cost hundreds of hours by now. Any donations are greatly appreciated.\n\nCross-browser\nPlease note that not all features work the same (or at all) as WebExtension support in browsers is not perfect yet.\n\nProblem, bug, broken, question, request?\nPlease use the linked support site or email for all non-review communication. AMO policy protects both users and developers by demanding certain quality standards from addons as well as reviews. Severely disfunctional addons are not published. Reviews and ratings must consider the entire addon, set reasonable expectations, and be timeless: a bad rating focusing solely on a systemic bug or on a problem not suffered by other users will stay long after the issue is resolved. AMO also gives extremely limited communication abilities, so contacting me properly will get your issue resolved much better and faster.","screenshots":[],"homepageURL":"https://gitlab.com/Marnes/webextensions","supportURL":"https://gitlab.com/Marnes/webextensions/-/issues","contributionURL":"https://buymeacoffee.com/marnes?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.3708,"reviewCount":94,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/double-click-image-download/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":277,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/double-click-image-download/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3780213/double_click_image_download-7.1.2.xpi","updateDate":1621628130000},{"id":"arc-dark-theme@afnankhan","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.2b26add4b394.png","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.d144b50f2bb8.png","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.452018499894.png"},"type":"theme","name":"Arc Dark Theme","version":"2021.6.2","creator":{"name":"Afnan Khan","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5641275/"},"developers":[],"description":"Arc Dark theme for Firefox","fullDescription":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/2918/2918406.png?modified=1622821433","width":680,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/2918/2918406.png?modified=1622821433","thumbnailWidth":473,"thumbnailHeight":64},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/full/2918/2918408.svg?modified=1622821434","width":720,"height":92,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/version-previews/thumbs/2918/2918408.jpg?modified=1622821434","thumbnailWidth":720,"thumbnailHeight":92}],"homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.794,"reviewCount":130,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arc-dark-theme-we/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":605,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arc-dark-theme-we/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3786185/arc_dark_theme_we-2021.6.2.xpi","updateDate":1622635824000},{"id":"{a4c4eda4-fb84-4a84-b4a1-f7c1cbf2a1ad}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/817/817698-32.png?modified=1722688571","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/817/817698-64.png?modified=1722688571","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/817/817698-128.png?modified=1722688571"},"type":"extension","name":"Refined GitHub","version":"24.8.3","creator":{"name":"Sindre Sorhus","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/6122708/"},"developers":[{"name":"Fregante","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/2225784/"}],"description":"Simplifies the GitHub interface and adds many useful features.","fullDescription":"We use GitHub a lot and notice many annoyances we'd like to fix.

You can enable/disable/move options, create sub-menus/separators.\n\n- Customizable mouse/keyboard controls\n- Option to switch tabs with mouse-wheel.\n- Configurable drag and drop behavior.\n- A growing list of available actions for mouse/keyboard bindings.\n\n- Customizable styles\nSidebery provides full control of styles for sidebar and group page via variables and custom CSS.\n\n- Snapshots\nYou can setup auto snapshots that will keep info about open windows and tabs.\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n    Sidebery keeps all data that needed to correct work on the user's machine and doesn't send any kind of data to the outside.\n\n\n\nSource code\n\n    Source code can be found here: https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\n    - \"Access recently closed tabs\" - needed for the \"Undo close tab\" function.\n    - \"Access browser tabs\" - needed to get info and control tabs.\n    - \"Store unlimited amount of client-side data\" - needed to store favicons cache and snapshots.\n\n\n\nOptional permissions\n\n    - \"Access your data for all websites\" and \"Control browser proxy settings\" - Required for the next features:\n        - Context menu option for cleaning cookies\n        - Proxy and url rules of containers\n        - Page-screenshots for the group page and windows selection panel\n        - Changing the User-Agent per container- \"Hide and show browser tabs\" - Required for the next features:\n        - Hiding tabs on inactive panels\n        - Hiding folded tabs- \"Read and modify bookmarks\" - needed for bookmarking the tabs and bookmarks panel functionality.\n    - \"Access browsing history\" - for history panel functionality.\n    - \"Input data to the clipboard\" - Context menu option for copying urls of tabs and bookmarks\n    - \"Download files and read and modify the browser’s download history\" - Auto-export of snapshots.\n\nNote: You can deny these permissions at any time on the settings page.\n\nNotes\n\n    - Firefox doesn't allow addons to hide the native (horizontal) tab bar.
